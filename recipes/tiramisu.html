<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Tiramisu is a timeless no-bake Italian dessert combining espresso-dipped ladyfingers and a creamy lightly sweetened mascarpone cream. This recipe is from the late Maida Heatter and is easily the best homemade tiramisu recipe that I’ve ever tried.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
  <li>400ml double cream</li>
  <li>250g mascarpone</li>
  <li>75ml marsala</li>
  <li>5 tbsp golden caster sugar</li>
  <li>300ml coffee, made with 2 tbsp coffee granules and 300ml boiling water</li>
  <li>175g sponge fingers</li>
  <li>25g dark chocolate</li>
  <li>2tsp cocoa powder</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Put the double cream, mascarpone, marsala and golden caster sugar in a large bowl.</li>
  <li>Whisk until the cream and mascarpone have completely combined and have the consistency of thickly whipped cream.</li>
  <li>Pour the coffee into a shallow dish. Dip in a few of the sponge fingers at a time, turning for a few seconds until they are nicely soaked, but not soggy. Layer these in a dish until you’ve used half the sponge fingers, then spread over half of the creamy mixture.</li>
  <li>Using the coarse side of the grater, grate over most of the dark chocolate. Then repeat the layers (you should use up all the coffee), finishing with the creamy layer.</li>
  <li>Cover and chill for a few hours or overnight. Will keep in the fridge for up to two days.</li>
  <li>To serve, dust with the cocoa powder and grate over the remainder of the chocolate.</li>
</ol>
